# 1 FP1-based FPGA Development Suite

<a name="sec_1_1"></a>
## 1.1 Overview
The FP1-based FPGA development suite is a cloud FPGA hardware/software development kit based on Huawei enterprise cloud services. This suite helps users to design, simulate, implement, and one-click compilation run on FPGA, and provides professional design and verification components to help users efficiently implement FPGA development. The suite provides tools for hardware and software development, respectively. The hardware development suite helps users to complete project compilation, simulation, generate the .dcp or .xclbin file， and register an FPGA image. The software development suite guides users to load an FPGA image, and compile and debug user applications.

<a name="sec_1_2"></a>
## 1.2 Preparations
Before using the FPGA development suite, you must perform 1.2.1~1.2.3 steps to complete the development kit acquisition and tool installation and configuration. The hardware development tools are stored in the [hardware](./fp1/hardware) directory, including Vivado and SDAccel development tools. The software development tools are stored in the [software](./fp1/software) directory, including configure files, drivers, tools, and related applications which are needed when running instances.

### 1.2.1 Downloading Suite

+ For HTTPS connections, run the `git clone https://github.com/fpga_accel/poc-fpga.git` command to download the suite.

+ For SSH connections, run the `git clone git@github.com:fpga_accel/poc-fpga.git` command to download the suite.

> Ensure that the ECS is bound with an EIP before using the ECS to download the development suite.<br/>
> Ensure that the Git tool is installed before downloading the development suite.

### 1.2.2 Configuring Intranet DNS 
After the intranet DNS is configured, the ECS can access relevant cloud services through the intranet of the virtual private cloud, providing users with a more stable and reliable network environment. For more information, see the "Configuring Intranet DNS" section in the [FACS User's Guide](https://support.huaweicloud.com/usermanual-fpga/en-us_topic_0069154765.html). 

<a name="sec_1_2_3"></a>
### 1.2.3 configuring and Installing the FPGA Image Management Tool
The fisclient is a cross-platform command-line interface (CLI) tool used for FPGA image management, which is mandatory before FPGA image loading. By using fisclient, you can register, delete, and query FPGA images (AEIs), or manage the association between AEIs and elastic cloud server (ECS) images. You can associate an AEI with an ESC image, and release the AEI to the cloud market or share it with other users through the ESC image.

>For details, please see the chapter of installation and configuration in [fisclient README](./cli/fisclient/README.md).

# 2 FPGA Development Guide for High-Performance Architecture
When a high-performance architecture is used, the FPGA development is divided to three scenarios: hardware development, software development, and example using. During hardware development, you can generate and register an FPGA image by using the Vivado tools. During software development, you can develop applications based on the existing FPGA image. By using examples, you can quickly master the FPGA development process under the current server architecture.

+ [2.2 Software Development Process](#sec_2_2)
+ [2.3 Using a Vivado-Based Example](#sec_2_3)

<a name="sec_2_1"></a>
## 2.1 Hardware Development Process
When a high-performance architecture FACS is used, the FPGA hardware development is based on the Vivado tools. This development process guides users to create, compile, and simulate a project, generate a .dcp file, and register an FPGA image (AEI, Accelerated Engine Image). After the hardware development, if you need to develop your own applications based on the registered FPGA image, see section [2.2](#sec_2_2).

<a name="sec_2_1_1"></a>
### 2.1.1 Generating a DCP File
For details about how to develop a .dcp file based on the Vivado, see [Vivado-Based Hardware Development Process](./fp1/docs/Implementation_Process_of_Vivado_based_Hardware_Development.md).

<a name="sec_2_1_2"></a>
### 2.1.2 Registering an FPGA Image
Before registering an FPGA image, if you have not installed this tool yet, please install the image management tool fisclient by referring to section [1.2.2](#sec_1_2_2).

#### Step 1 Registering an FPGA Image
You can use AEI_Register.sh to register an FPGA image with the image management module. After the registration, an ID is assigned to the FPGA image. Please record this ID, because it can be used to query the registration status, and load, delete, and associate the image.

[Registering an FPGA Image](./fp1/docs/Register_an_FPGA_image_for_a_DPDK_project.md)

#### Step 2 Querying the FPGA Image
Users can run the `fis fpga-image-list` command to query information about an FPGA image. If the image status is **active**, users can load the image using the image ID.

> For details about how to use the fisclient to query the FPGA image, see [fisclient README](./cli/fisclient/README.md).

<a name="sec_2_2"></a>
## 2.2 Software Development Process
After hardware development and FPGA image registration, you can develop FPGA user applications by referring to this section.

<a name="sec_2_2_1"></a>
### 2.2.1 Loading the FPGA Image
After an FPGA image is registered, use the FPGA image loading tool FpgaCmdEntry to load the image to the FPGA before software development.

#### Step 1 Compiling and Installing the FPGA Image Loading Tool 	
The FPGA image loading tool FpgaCmdEntry is a command-line interface (CLI) tool, which supports FPGA information query, image loading and query, and virtual LED status query. 

For details, please see the chapter of compiling and installing in [fpga_tool README](./fp1/tools/fpga_tool/README.md).

#### Step 2 Loading the FPGA Image
For details, see the following file.

[load an fpga image](./fp1/tools/fpga_tool/docs/load_an_fpga_image.md)

> For more details of loading tool, see [fpga_tool README](./fp1/tools/fpga_tool/README.md). 

<a name="sec_2_2_2"></a>
### 2.2.2 Compiling and Debugging User Applications
The high-performance architecture development mode uses the DPDK architecture to exchange data between the FPGA and the processors. For details about how to compile and debug user applications, see [DPDK-Based User Applications Development Description](./fp1/software/app/dpdk_app/README.md).
If you need to modify the driver, refer to [DPDK-Based Driver Development Description](./fp1/software/userspace/dpdk_src/README.md).

### 2.2.3 Running User Applications

After the FPGA image loading and application compilation, you can go to the [huaweicloud-fpga/fp1/software/app/dpdk_app/bin](./fp1/software/app/dpdk_app/bin) directory to run user applications.

## 2.3 Vivado-Based Example
For high-performance server architectures, FAC services provide three examples. Example 1 implements user logic version reading, data inversion, and addition functions. Example 2 implements user logic DMA (Direct Memory Access) loopback channels and DDR (DDR SDRAM) read functions. Example 3 implements user logic FPGA memory manage unit (FMMU) function. The following figure shows the Vivado-based example operation process.

# 3 FPGA Development Guide for General-Purpose Architecture
When a general-purpose architecture is used, the FPGA development is divided to three scenarios: hardware development, software development, and example using. During hardware development, you can generate and register an FPGA image by using the SDAccel tools. During software development, you can develop applications based on the existing FPGA image.
