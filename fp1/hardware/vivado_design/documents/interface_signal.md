* The FPGA acceleration card is connected to the CPU through the PCIe3.0 x16 interface with four external DDR4s. The FPGA acceleration card supports high-speed device interconnection interfaces and 100 GB Ethernet ports. FPGA logic consists of `Shell and user logic`.
  - Shell (SH): indicates static logic provided by FACS, including peripheral interfaces such as PCIe and DDR4.
  - User logic (UL): indicates dynamic logic developed by users.

  You need to use SH and UL to compile the `AEI file` of FPGA images.      
  This document describes hardware interfaces between SH and UL and the function of shell.  

# Shell Function
* Provides access to PCIe BAR1/BAR5. 
* Provides access to the PCIe DMA channel.
* Provides access to one DDR4 mapping space.
* Implements debugging, status, and control functions.

# Shell Interfaces
The shell function is connected to user logic through the AXI-Lite or AXI4 interface.
* The 32-bit AXI-Lite interface is used for BAR1/BAR5 space access.
* The 512-bit AXI4 interface is used for DMA channel access.
* The 512-bit AXI4 interface is used for one DDR4 mapping space access.

# Clocks and Reset Signals
* **clk_100m dma** indicates the AXI4 interface clock for channel access, and **rst_100m** indicates synchronous reset.
* **clk_200m** indicates the AXI4 interface clock for DDR4 mapping space access, and **rst_200m** indicates synchronous reset.
* **clk_hpi** indicates the AXI4 interface clock for BAR1/BAR5 space access, and **rst_hpi** indicates synchronous reset.
* The clock sources share the same PLL/VCO output and have a strict phase relationship. The frequency of the **clk_hpi** clock is 200 MHz.
