## Example Description

- example1

This example implements user logic `version reading, data inversion, and addition` functions. You can refer to existing Huawei design components and use this example to learn about the development, simulation, verification, and test processes on the cloud. For details, see [Example 1 User Guide](./example1/README.md).

- example2

This example implements user logic `version reading, 4 DDR read/write access, and DMA data loopback` functions. You can quickly implement the acceleration design by referring to involved interfaces and interaction processes. For details, see [Example 2 User Guide](./example2/README.md).

- example3

This example implements user logic `version reading and 4 DDR read/write control` functions. You can quickly implement the acceleration design by referring to involved interfaces and interaction processes. For details, see [Example 3 User Guide](./example3/README.md).
