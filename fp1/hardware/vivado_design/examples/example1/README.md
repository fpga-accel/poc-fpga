## Operation Instructions

### Example Building

Go to the **prj** directory, run the `build.sh` script, and wait until the building is completed.
For details, see [Example 1 Building Guide](./prj/README.md).

The building result is stored in the `/prj/build/checkpoints/to_facs` directory.

The building commands are as follows:

```bash
  $ cd $WORK_DIR/hardware/vivado_design/examples/example1/prj
  $ sh build.sh
```

### Example Simulation

For details, see [Example 1 Simulation Guide](./sim/README.md).

### Example Testing

1. Go to the `$WORK_DIR/software/app/dpdk_app/example1` directory and run the **make** command.
2. After the compilation is completed, perform example tests by referring to [Application Operation Instructions](../../../../software/app/dpdk_app/README.md).
